# InnerAI Clone + BMAD Method - Workflow Plan

## Overview
Integration of BMAD Method's agentic planning framework with the InnerAI Clone project to enhance development workflow, planning capabilities, and team collaboration.

## Project Context
- **Main Project**: InnerAI Clone - Advanced AI chat application with payment integration
- **Enhancement**: BMAD Method integration for agentic development workflow
- **Goal**: Streamlined development process with collaborative AI agents

## Current Project Status
- ✅ Fully functional Next.js application with React/TypeScript
- ✅ Authentication system (NextAuth.js)
- ✅ Payment integration (Stripe + MercadoPago)
- ✅ AI chat system with multiple providers (OpenAI, OpenRouter)
- ✅ Template and knowledge base system
- ✅ Dashboard and analytics
- ✅ Comprehensive testing suite

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ✅
- [x] Install BMAD Method framework
- [x] Configure project structure
- [x] Set up required directories

### Phase 2: Configuration & Customization
- [ ] Create custom agent teams for SuperClaude development
- [ ] Configure BMAD workflows for the project
- [ ] Integrate with existing SuperClaude configuration
- [ ] Set up IDE integration

### Phase 3: Enhancement & Testing
- [ ] Test agentic planning workflow
- [ ] Create development stories
- [ ] Validate integration with SuperClaude features
- [ ] Document best practices

## BMAD Integration Points

### Core Components Installed:
- **Agents**: Analyst, Architect, PM, Scrum Master, Developer, QA
- **Workflows**: Greenfield/Brownfield development patterns
- **Templates**: PRD, Architecture, Story templates
- **Checklists**: Quality assurance and validation

### InnerAI Enhancement Areas:
1. **Agentic Planning**: Use BMAD agents for feature planning
2. **Context Engineering**: Enhanced development stories
3. **Collaborative Workflow**: Multi-agent development process
4. **Documentation**: Structured PRD and architecture docs

## BMAD Agent Configuration for InnerAI

### Primary Development Areas:
1. **Frontend Development** (React/Next.js components)
2. **Backend API** (API routes and services)
3. **Payment Systems** (Stripe/MercadoPago integration)
4. **AI Integration** (Chat system and providers)
5. **Testing & QA** (Unit, integration, e2e tests)

### Agent Team Assignments:
- **Analyst**: Requirements gathering for new features
- **Product Manager**: Feature prioritization and roadmap
- **Architect**: Technical architecture and system design
- **Scrum Master**: Story creation and sprint planning
- **Developer**: Implementation and code quality
- **QA**: Testing strategy and validation

## Integration with Existing Tools

### Development Stack:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Database**: Prisma with PostgreSQL/Supabase
- **Testing**: Jest, Playwright, React Testing Library
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (configured)
- **Deployment**: Digital Ocean App Platform

## Next Steps
1. Run BMAD Analyst agent on current InnerAI codebase
2. Generate comprehensive PRD for ongoing development
3. Create architecture documentation
4. Set up development story templates
5. Configure agent workflows for the team
