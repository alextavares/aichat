### 3. Integration Layer
- **Configuration Fusion**: Merge SuperClaude and BMAD configs
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Coordinate between agents and personas
- **Context Management**: Preserve context across agent interactions
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation and review processes

## Agent Collaboration Model

### Primary Agents
1. **Analyst**: Requirements gathering, stakeholder analysis
2. **Product Manager**: Feature prioritization, roadmap planning
3. **Architect**: Technical design, system architecture
4. **Scrum Master**: Story creation, workflow management
5. **Developer**: Code implementation, technical execution
6. **QA**: Testing, validation, quality assurance

### Collaboration Patterns
- **Sequential**: Analyst → PM → Architect → SM → Developer → QA
- **Parallel**: Multiple agents working on different aspects simultaneously
- **Iterative**: Continuous feedback loops between agents
- **Hybrid**: Combination based on task complexity and requirements

## Technical Stack

### Technologies
- **Runtime**: Node.js v20+
- **Configuration**: YAML-based agent and workflow definitions
- **Documentation**: Markdown with structured templates
- **Integration**: File-based communication and state management
